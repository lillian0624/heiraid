## ü§ù Contribution Process

We welcome contributions to enhance HeirAid! Follow these steps to collaborate effectively:

1. **Pick an Issue**:

   - Visit the [Issues tab](https://github.com/NoelOsiro/heiraid/issues) on GitHub.
   - Choose an open issue that matches your skills (e.g., data extraction, frontend design) or create a new one if needed.
   - Assign yourself to the issue or comment to claim it.

2. **Solve the Issue**:

   - Create a feature branch from `develop`:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git pull origin develop
     git checkout -b feature/your-issue-name
     ```
   - Implement your solution (e.g., update code, add data) in the relevant folder (e.g., `/src/feature_a/` or `/src/frontend/`).
   - Test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.

3. **Create a Pull Request (PR) to `develop`**:

   - Commit and push your changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Resolve #issue-number: Brief description"
     git push origin feature/your-issue-name
     ```
   - Open a PR on GitHub targeting the `develop` branch.
   - Include a clear title (e.g., "Fix #5: Add ChatComponent") and description outlining your changes.

4. **Request Review**:

   - Assign a reviewer (e.g., @li-username) in the PR.
   - Respond to feedback and make necessary adjustments.
   - Ensure at least one approval is received before proceeding.

5. **Merge to `develop`**:

   - Once approved, merge the PR into `develop`:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git pull origin develop
     git merge --no-ff feature/your-issue-name
     git push origin develop
     ```
   - Delete the feature branch if no further work is needed.

6. **Merge to `main`**:
   - After testing on `develop`, create a PR from `develop` to `main` for stable releases.
   - Follow the same review process, then merge:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git merge --no-ff develop
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Tag releases (e.g., `v1.0.0`) for milestone tracking.

### Best Practices

- Keep commits small and focused.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages referencing issue numbers (e.g., `#5`).
- Use `develop` for active development and `main` for production-ready code.
- Document changes in `docs/meeting_notes.md` for team alignment.
